***Pywal themes by plasmoduck***

Here is my collection of custom made (what I think are gorgeous) pywal themes for use with dwm and st.
Some themes contain a wallpaper which the colors are based off.

**To use**
Simply clone the repo and edit your dwm config.h and st config.h and point it to your theme of choice.
